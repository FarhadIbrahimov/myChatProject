## Introduction

The MERN Stack is a combination of technologies used for building web applications. It includes:

- **MongoDB**: Database management system.
- **Express.js**: Web framework for building backend applications.
- **React**: Frontend library for building user interfaces.
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for server-side development.

For a comprehensive explanation of the MERN Stack, you can visit the [MERN Stack Documentation](https://www.mongodb.com/mern-stack).

## React.js

React.js is a frontend library developed by Facebook. It offers:

- Reusable components.
- Efficient rendering with the Virtual DOM.
- Exceptional performance.

Explore the [React.js Documentation](https://react.dev/) for more information.

## Node.js

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 engine. It's great for:

- Scalable web servers.
- Real-time systems development.
- Utilizing the Node Package Manager (npm).

Learn more from the [Node.js Documentation](https://nodejs.org/en/docs).

## Express.js

Express.js is a web framework for Node.js, offering:

- Powerful routing API.
- High performance.
- Abundance of third-party plugins.

Explore the [Express.js Documentation](https://expressjs.com/) for detailed information.

## MongoDB

MongoDB is a cross-platform NoSQL and document-oriented database with:

- High scalability.
- Flexible schema.
- Always-on availability.
