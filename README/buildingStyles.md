- added Container
- inside Container added Boxes ,
  In Chakra UI, the Container component serves as a responsive wrapper for your content.
  The Box component is a versatile and fundamental building block that serves as a wrapper for styling and positioning elements. It is used for creating layout structures, applying styling, and managing spacing and positioning of content within your components. Essentially, the Box component is a lightweight and flexible container that allows you to apply various styling properties without adding any additional semantic elements to the DOM.

- First Box is for the name, second Box is for Login and SignUp components, [added Tabs to second Box](https://chakra-ui.com/docs/components/tabs/usage)
