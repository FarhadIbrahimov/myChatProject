We use Socket.io for real time messaging

[socket.io](https://socket.io/docs/v4/tutorial/introduction)

after installing socket.io and writing logic for it, tested it works

downloaded json file for typing animation from [Lottie files website](https://lottiefiles.com/)

then downloaded library
in the frontend folder , client folder run `npm i react-lottie`
since i am usning react version 18 and lottie is working for react 16 i had to run command `npm install react-lottie --legacy-peer-deps`
installed `react-lottie` with the `--legacy-peer-deps` flag, which allows npm to use an older, potentially incompatible version of a dependency.
